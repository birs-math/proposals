                        <h2>Diversity and Inclusivity Survey</h2>
                        <p>BIRS is committed to providing a welcoming environment to all participants at BIRS events. It is our goal to host workshops that are demographically diverse and to foster opportunities for career growth and development that are inclusive to all.</p>

                        <p>The collection of information from our participants is one way that BIRS supports this goal. This information enables us to see trends, improvements, and shortfalls in the diversity of our participants. Ultimately, it provides data that can be used for evidence-based decision-making to promote greater inclusion and diversity within mathematics.</p>

                        <p>Answers to questions marked with (&dagger;) will be reported to organizers in aggregate form, only once enough data is available. All other answers to this survey will be stored electronically upon submission, and access is limited only to BIRS staff on a need-to-know basis.</p>

                        <p>For answers to common questions about our survey, including which data is reported to organizers, and how, see our
