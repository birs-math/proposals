    <h1>Dear <%= @person&.fullname %>:</h1>
    <p>
      We have received a proposal for a workshop at the Banff International Research Station,
      submitted by <%= @proposal.lead_organizer&.fullname %> and titled,
      "<%= @proposal.title %>". If successful, the program will take place
      sometime during the calendar year <%= @proposal.year %>, and could run at one of the
      following locations: <%= @proposal.the_locations %>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you in principle be interested in attending such a workshop, if the
      proposal is accepted and the program dates suit your schedule? Knowing your
      response would help the organizing committee and the BIRS review committee
      gauge the appeal of our proposed event to the wider mathematical community.
    </p>
