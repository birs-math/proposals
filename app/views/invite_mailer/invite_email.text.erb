If you indicate a positive response (Yes or Maybe), you'll also be asked to fill out a Diversity and Inclusivity survey. This survey is mandatory, but it should only take a minute to fill out, and for all questions, you are welcome to select Prefer not to answer. Data collected through this survey is anonymous and non-identifying. It will help organizers ensure a balanced composition of the participant pool and showcase the diversity and inclusivity of the proposed program to the review committee.

Thank you for indicating your interest in this proposed workshop!
