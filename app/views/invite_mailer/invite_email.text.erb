Dear <%= @person&.fullname %>:
===============================================

We <%= @proposal.lead_organizer&.fullname %> are in the process of putting together a proposal for
a <%= @proposal.proposal_type.name %> titled "<%= @proposal.title %>" for submission to the Banff
International Research Station. If successful, the program will take place
sometime during the calendar year [year_no], and could run at any of the
following locations <%= @proposal.locations.pluck(:name).join(', ') %>.

Would you in principle be interested in attending such a workshop, if the
proposal is accepted and the program dates suit your schedule? Knowing your
response would help the organizing committee and the BIRS review committee
gauge the appeal of our proposed event to the wider mathematical community.

Kindly indicate your response by <%= @invite.deadline_date.to_date %> at the link below:

<%= link_to 'Click here', proposal_invite_url(@proposal,@invite) %>

Thank you for considering our request!

[The organizing committee]
